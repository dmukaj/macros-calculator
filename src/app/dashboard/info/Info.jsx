          (Macros)?
        </h1>
        <p>
          In the context of health and fitness, macronutrients are the nutrients
          that provide the energy necessary for our bodies to function. They are
          required in large amounts and are crucial for growth, metabolism, and
          other bodily functions. In this calculator, we only calculate three
          primary macronutrients, daily carbohydrate, protein, and fat needs.

              <strong>Function: </strong>
              Carbohydrates are the body&apos;s primary source of energy. They
              are broken down into glucose, which is used by cells for energy.
              They also play a role in the functioning of the brain, kidneys,
              heart muscles, and central nervous system.

              <strong>Function: </strong>
              Fats provide a concentrated source of energy and are necessary for
              absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). They also play a
              role in protecting organs, maintaining cell membranes, and
              producing important hormones.

              Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues,
              including muscles, skin, and organs. They are also important for
              producing enzymes, hormones, and other body chemicals. Proteins
              are made up of amino acids, some of which the body can produce,
              while others, known as essential amino acids, must be obtained
              from food.

        <p>
          A macro-based diet looks at the percentage combination or ratios of
          carbs, proteins and fats in a personâ€™s diet rather than total calorie
          counts alone. These traditionally have been set as percentages for
          total calories, falling somewhere within the following USDA
          guidelines:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Carbohydrate: </strong> 45 to 65 percent
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protein: </strong> 10 to 35 percent
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fats: </strong> 20 to 35 percent
        </li>
